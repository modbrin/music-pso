# Particle Swarm Optimisation approach to Music Generation

> This project demonstrates how simple approach - particle swarm optimisation can be used to generate short music tracks. Each track consists of N notes/chords which is mapped into N-dimensional vector. A number of such vectors is generated randomly and then optimised with fitness function as a set of `good` music rules.

> Project was done as a part of `Introduction to Artificial Intelligence` course (2017).
